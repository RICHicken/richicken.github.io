                <p>The <span class="spanGlow">DnD Character Generator</span> was my first time ever using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was made for my friends to use in their campaigns. The page itself is very bare-bones with simple visual elements, along with a responsive design for smaller resolutions. But, it is very easy for the user to select which source-books they want to use. On top of that, because all the data is retrieved by parsing&#160; JSON data, it is very easy for me to add new source-books.</p>

Assigning random students to jobs each day, making sure every student gets to be each job at least once. And creating student groups. This program allows teachers to do these tasks instantly since raffles and jobs can be saved, along with the student names.</p>

                <p>This is a plugin for Minecraft: Java Edition (version 1.15.2) which allows players to take control of almost any hostile mob in the game!
