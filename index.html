                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>This is a plugin for Minecraft: Java Edition (version 1.15.2) which allows players to take control of almost any hostile mob in the game! This allows for two different types of game modes. The default mode is if a player dies, then the person who killed them becomes the main player, and the first one to beat the game is the player character wins. The alternate mode assigns one player is the speedrunner, who needs to beat the whole game, and the game ends if they die. Resetting is easy because you donâ€™t need to manually set the game mode!</p>
